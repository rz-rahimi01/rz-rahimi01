## 👋 Meet Me  

Hey, I’m **Rahim Zai Rahimi** — a final-year **Computer Science student** passionate about solving real-world problems through code. I build cross-platform mobile apps using **Flutter**, automate workflows with **Python**, and explore the frontiers of **AI** in my spare time.

Over the past few months, I’ve taken on a self-driven **Flutter Challenges**, where I committed daily to learning, building, and shipping real apps—from simple UI screens to AI-powered tools.

Whether it’s crafting beautiful UIs, integrating Firebase backends, or experimenting with sentiment analysis APIs, I’m always up for building something that’s **useful**, **scalable**, and **meaningful**.
